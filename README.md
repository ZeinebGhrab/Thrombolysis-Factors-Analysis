# Stroke Clinical Data Statistical Analysis

This project involves a series of statistical tests applied to a clinical dataset related to stroke, aiming to evaluate associations and differences between key medical variables.

## Features

- ✅ Chi-square tests to assess dependency between categorical variables (e.g., Stroke and Rankin score)
- ✅ Mann-Whitney U and t-tests to compare NIHSS scores between patient groups
- ✅ Kruskal-Wallis and ANOVA tests for NIHSS scores across age groups
- ✅ Shapiro-Wilk test for normality checks
- ✅ Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- ✅ Clean and interpretable code in Python

## Insights

- Uncovers statistical relationships between stroke presence, NIHSS scores, age, and lifestyle habits
- Offers a reproducible approach to exploratory medical data analysis
- Facilitates decision-making by revealing significant clinical patterns

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Statistical Methods** (Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA, Shapiro-Wilk)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
